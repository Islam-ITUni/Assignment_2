Max Heap Implementation



Overview

This project implements a Max Heap data structure in Java with the following features:

\- In-place heap implementation using arrays

\- Increase-key operation

\- Extract-max operation

\- Merge operation for combining two heaps

\- Comprehensive performance tracking



Complexity Analysis



Time Complexity

\- Insert: O(log n) worst-case

\- Extract Max: O(log n) worst-case  

\- Increase Key: O(log n) worst-case

\- Build Heap: O(n) worst-case

\- Merge: O(n) worst-case



Space Complexity

\- Auxiliary Space: O(1) for all operations (in-place)

\- Total Space: O(n) for storing n elements
